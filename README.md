# LeaderPath-Wizard
LeaderPath is a gamified, assistant-driven design tool developed for Theme 3: Efficiency and Assistant Tools. It is designed to empower education leaders—such as NGO heads and school principals—to move from a "blank page" to a structured, data-driven program design using a guided interface.
